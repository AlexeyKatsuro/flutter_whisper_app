## Rule: Generate Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a mobile feature

### Input
A task description in natural language, provided by the user.  
Example:  
> "Task: Add a microphone button on the main screen that records audio and sends it to the server for transcription."

### Output
Create a new folder and file:
```

doc/{short\_feature\_name}/{short\_feature\_name}\_prd.md

```
Where:
- `{short_feature_name}` is a short kebab-case identifier of the feature (e.g., `voice_input`, `dark_mode`, `chat_reactions`).

The file should contain a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** in **English**, following the template below.

---

## PRD Template

### 1. Context & Goals
- **Goal:** Clear statement of what this feature enables for the user.
- **Why important:** Business or user value behind the feature.
- **KPIs / Success Criteria:** How success will be measured (e.g., adoption, performance, NPS).

### 2. Functional Requirements
- Describe the main flow step by step.
- List all UI states and transitions.
- Define error handling and fallback behaviors.
- Cover both the happy path and edge cases.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** expected response times, latency, etc.
- **Reliability:** how data and states are preserved, retry behavior.
- **Compatibility:** target OS versions, devices, constraints.
- **Security & Privacy:** handling of sensitive data, encryption, retention.
- **Accessibility:** compliance with accessibility guidelines.
- **Localization:** requirements for multiple languages if applicable.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria (use Gherkin format)
Provide scenarios in **Given–When–Then** style:
```

Given \[precondition]
When \[action]
Then \[expected outcome]

```
Include at least:
- Successful flow
- Error cases (no permission, no network, server error, etc.)
- Edge cases (empty input, cancellation, interruption)

### 5. Success Metrics
- Define measurable outcomes (success rates, error rates, latency, adoption).
- Include target thresholds (e.g., 95% success within 3 seconds).

---

### Rules & Best Practices
- Keep the PRD written in **clear, simple English**.
- Use bullet points and structured lists for readability.
- Always cover both functional and non-functional aspects.
- Ensure acceptance criteria are **testable**.
- Focus on mobile application context (UI states, offline behavior, OS restrictions).

### Example Output Location
If the user request is:
> "Task: Implement voice input on the main screen"

The generated file should be:
```

doc/voice-input/voice-input\_prd.md

```

And contain the PRD filled out using the template above.
