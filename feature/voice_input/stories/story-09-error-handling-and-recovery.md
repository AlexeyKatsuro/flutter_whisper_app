# Story 09: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery

## Overview
Implement robust error handling, recovery mechanisms, and user-friendly error communication throughout the voice input feature. This story ensures graceful degradation and clear user guidance in all failure scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Clear, actionable error messages for users
- [ ] Graceful fallback behaviors (online → offline → manual input)
- [ ] Error recovery without requiring app restart
- [ ] Proper error logging and reporting integration

## Tasks Checklist

### Error Classification and Hierarchy
- [ ] Review and enhance `VoiceInputException` hierarchy
- [ ] Create specific exceptions for each failure scenario
- [ ] Implement error severity levels (recoverable vs non-recoverable)
- [ ] Add error context information for debugging

### Automatic Recovery Mechanisms
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures
- [ ] Add automatic fallback: online → offline → manual input
- [ ] Create recovery strategies for recording interruptions
- [ ] Implement state recovery after app backgrounding/foregrounding

### User Error Communication
- [ ] Create `ErrorMessageBuilder` for user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement contextual error display (SnackBar vs Dialog)
- [ ] Add actionable error messages with retry/settings buttons
- [ ] Create error state UI components with clear recovery paths

### Permission Error Handling
- [ ] Enhance permission denial error handling
- [ ] Add clear explanation dialogs for permission requirements
- [ ] Implement settings navigation with return handling
- [ ] Handle permission revocation during app usage

### Recording Error Recovery
- [ ] Handle microphone access interruptions (calls, other apps)
- [ ] Implement recording resume after interruptions
- [ ] Add partial recording recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Handle file system errors during recording

### Transcription Error Handling
- [ ] Implement smart fallback for transcription failures
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for temporary API failures
- [ ] Handle unsupported audio format scenarios
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for low-quality audio

### Network Error Management
- [ ] Handle network connectivity loss during operations
- [ ] Implement request timeout and retry logic
- [ ] Add offline mode detection and user notification
- [ ] Handle API rate limiting and server errors

### Error Logging Integration
- [ ] Integrate with `core/error_reporter` for crash reporting
- [ ] Add structured error logging with context
- [ ] Implement error analytics for improvement insights
- [ ] Add debug information for development troubleshooting

## Testing Verification

### Error Scenario Tests
- [ ] Test all identified error scenarios systematically
- [ ] Verify automatic retry mechanisms work correctly
- [ ] Test fallback behaviors in various failure combinations
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and actionable

### Recovery Testing
- [ ] Test recovery from all error states without app restart
- [ ] Verify state consistency after error recovery
- [ ] Test partial operation recovery (interrupted recordings)
- [ ] Test error handling during rapid state changes

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Verify error messages provide clear guidance
- [ ] Test error UI doesn't block normal app functionality
- [ ] Verify retry mechanisms are user-friendly
- [ ] Test error accessibility (screen reader compatibility)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test error handling integration with core error reporting
- [ ] Verify error logging captures sufficient context
- [ ] Test error scenarios across different device types
- [ ] Test error handling during app lifecycle changes

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Test error handling under high failure rates
- [ ] Verify memory management during error scenarios
- [ ] Test performance impact of error handling logic
- [ ] Test concurrent error scenarios

## Dependencies
- Story 01: Project Setup and Foundation
- Story 02: Permission Management System
- Story 03: Audio Recording Implementation
- Story 04: Offline Transcription Implementation
- Story 05: Online Transcription Service
- Story 06: Basic UI Components Implementation

- Story 08: Animations and Visual Polish

## Notes
- Error handling should be proactive, not reactive
- Focus on user experience - errors should guide users to solutions
- Implement comprehensive logging for production debugging
- Test error scenarios as thoroughly as happy path scenarios
- Consider edge cases and rare failure combinations
- Error recovery should be automatic when possible, manual when necessary
