# Story 01: Voice Input Project Setup and Foundation

## Overview
Set up the basic project structure for the voice input feature following the Sizzle Starter architecture patterns. This story creates the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Feature module structure created following Clean Architecture
- [x] Basic domain models defined with Freezed
- [x] Repository contracts established  
- [x] Dependency injection container setup
- [x] Basic BLoC structure with initial states
- [x] Project compiles without errors
- [x] All generated code is properly created

## Tasks Checklist

### Project Structure Setup
- [x] Create `feature/voice_input/voice_input_api/` directory structure
- [x] Create `pubspec.yaml` with proper dependencies (freezed, bloc, permission_handler, record, speech_to_text, etc.)
- [x] Set up `lib/voice_input_api.dart` as public API export file
- [x] Create `src/` subdirectories: `domain/`, `data/`, `application/`, `presentation/`

### Domain Layer Implementation  
- [x] Create `VoiceRecording` model with Freezed (`src/domain/model/voice_recording.dart`)
- [x] Create `TranscriptionResult` model with Freezed (`src/domain/model/transcription_result.dart`)
- [x] Create `VoiceInputPermission` model with Freezed (`src/domain/model/voice_input_permission.dart`)
- [x] Define `VoiceInputRepository` abstract interface (`src/domain/repositories/voice_input_repository.dart`)
- [x] Create custom exception hierarchy (`src/domain/exceptions/voice_input_exception.dart`)

### Application Layer Foundation
- [x] Create BLoC events with Freezed (`src/application/bloc/voice_input_event.dart`)
- [x] Create BLoC states with Freezed (`src/application/bloc/voice_input_state.dart`)
- [x] Create basic `VoiceInputBloc` class structure (`src/application/bloc/voice_input_bloc.dart`)

### Dependency Injection Setup
- [x] Create `VoiceInputContainer` class (`src/injection.dart`)
- [x] Define container factory method with placeholder implementations
- [x] Set up proper disposal methods

### Code Generation
- [x] Run `bash scripts/bootstrap.bash` to generate all Freezed code
- [x] Verify all generated files are created properly
- [x] Fix any compilation errors

## Testing Verification

### Compilation Test
- [x] Project builds successfully with `flutter pub get` and `flutter analyze`
- [x] No linting errors in the voice_input_api package
- [x] All imports resolve correctly

### Structure Verification
- [x] Feature follows Sizzle Starter architecture patterns
- [x] All domain models have proper Freezed generation
- [x] BLoC events and states are properly structured
- [x] Container pattern matches existing features (settings_api example)

### Code Quality Check
- [x] All files follow 100-character line length
- [x] Snake_case naming for files and directories
- [x] Proper public API exports through main library file
- [x] Clean separation of concerns across layers

## Dependencies
None - This is the foundation story

## Notes
- This story establishes the architectural foundation
- Focus on structure over functionality
- All models should be immutable using Freezed
- Follow the existing settings_api feature as a reference
- Repository implementations will be added in subsequent stories
