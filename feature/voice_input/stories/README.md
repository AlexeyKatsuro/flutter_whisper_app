## Development Guidelines

### Story Completion Criteria
- [ ] All tasks in the checklist are completed
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, widget tests)
- [ ] Code follows Sizzle Starter architecture patterns
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Manual testing completed on target devices
- [ ] Code review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Commit Strategy
- Create feature branch for each story: `feature/voice-input-story-XX`
- Make small, atomic commits within each story
- Commit message format: `feat(voice-input): story XX - description`
- Create PR for each completed story
- Merge to main after story completion and review

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside implementation (TDD recommended)
- Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Test on both iOS and Android platforms
- Include accessibility testing

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Sizzle Starter architecture patterns religiously
- Use Freezed for all data models
- Follow Clean Architecture layer separation
- Use BLoC for state management with sequential event processing
- Maintain 100-character line length limit
- Use snake_case for file and directory names

## Integration Points

### Main App Integration
The voice input feature integrates with the main app through:
- `VoiceInputField` widget for text input areas
- Dependency injection through composition root
- Shared core services (logger, error_reporter, rest_client)

### External Dependencies
- `record` package for audio recording
- `speech_to_text` package for offline transcription
- `permission_handler` for permission management
- `connectivity_plus` for network monitoring

## Architecture Compliance
All stories follow the Sizzle Starter template architecture:
- Clean Architecture with domain/data/application/presentation layers
- Dependency injection through container pattern
- BLoC pattern for state management
- Freezed for immutable data structures
- Feature-based modular organization

## Getting Started
1. Start with Story 01 - ensure foundation is solid
2. Follow stories in sequence - each builds on previous work
3. Complete all tasks and testing before moving to next story
4. Use `bash scripts/bootstrap.bash` for code generation [[memory:7026590]]
5. Commit progress regularly with descriptive messages

## Success Metrics
The completed feature should achieve:
- Voice input adoption rate > 30% of active users
- Recording completion rate > 95%
- Online transcription accuracy > 90%
- Offline transcription accuracy > 80%
- Recording start latency < 500ms
- User satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0
