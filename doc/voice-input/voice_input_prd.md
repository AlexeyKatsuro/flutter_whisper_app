# Voice Input Feature - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Context & Goals

### Goal
Enable users to input text through voice recording that gets transcribed automatically, providing an alternative to manual typing on the main screen.

### Why Important
- **User Experience**: Reduces friction for text input, especially on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Provides alternative input method for users with typing difficulties
- **Efficiency**: Faster text input compared to mobile keyboard typing
- **Modern UX**: Meets user expectations for voice-enabled mobile applications

### KPIs / Success Criteria
- Voice input feature adoption rate > 30% of active users
- Voice recording completion rate > 95%
- Online transcription accuracy > 90%
- Offline transcription accuracy > 80%
- User satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0 for voice input feature

## 2. Functional Requirements

### Main Flow
1. **Recording Initiation**: User taps microphone button on main screen
2. **Permission Check**: App requests microphone and speech recognition permissions if needed
3. **Network Detection**: App automatically detects network availability
4. **Recording State**: Visual indicator shows recording in progress, user speaks
5. **Recording Completion**: User taps "Finish" to stop recording
6. **Transcription Processing**: 
   - Online mode: Audio uploaded to transcription API
   - Offline mode: Platform speech recognition processes audio locally
7. **Result Display**: Transcribed text appears in text field
8. **Text Editing**: User can immediately edit the transcribed text

### UI States and Transitions
- **Idle State**: Text field with microphone button and network status indicator
- **Recording State**: Visual recording indicator, finish button, recording timer
- **Processing State**: Loading indicator with transcription mode indicator (online/offline)
- **Success State**: Transcribed text in field, option to record again
- **Error State**: Error message with retry options and fallback suggestions

### Error Handling and Fallback Behaviors
- **No Microphone Permission**: Show permission request with explanation
- **No Speech Permission**: Fallback to online-only transcription
- **Network Failure**: Automatic fallback to offline transcription
- **Server Error**: Retry option and offline fallback
- **Offline Transcription Failure**: Manual text input option
- **Recording Interruption**: Auto-save and resume or restart options

### Edge Cases
- Network loss during upload: Switch to offline processing
- App backgrounding during recording: Save state and allow resumption
- Maximum recording duration (60s): Auto-stop with transcription
- Empty audio/silence: Prompt user to try again
- Cancellation during recording: Clean up and return to idle state

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Recording start latency < 500ms after button tap
- Online transcription response time < 10 seconds
- Offline transcription response time < 5 seconds
- App remains responsive during all voice operations
- Memory usage < 50MB during recording and processing

### Reliability
- 98% successful fallback rate from online to offline mode
- Audio data preserved during app state changes
- Automatic retry mechanism for network failures
- State recovery after app restart during recording
- Clean audio file cleanup after transcription

### Compatibility
- **iOS**: 12.0+ with Speech framework support
- **Android**: API level 21+ with SpeechRecognizer support
- Support for various device microphone qualities
- Compatibility with different audio formats per platform
- Graceful degradation on older devices

### Security & Privacy
- Secure HTTPS communication for audio uploads
- Temporary audio file storage with automatic deletion
- No permanent storage of voice data
- User consent for voice data processing
- Compliance with platform privacy guidelines

### Accessibility
- VoiceOver/TalkBack support for all controls
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- High contrast support for visual indicators
- Minimum 44pt touch targets for all buttons
- Clear audio feedback for recording states

### Localization
- UI text support for app's supported languages
- Server-side transcription language detection
- Platform speech recognition language preference
- Fallback to device language settings

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### Successful Flow
```
Given user is on main screen with network connection
When user taps microphone button
Then recording starts within 500ms and shows recording indicator

Given user is recording audio
When user speaks for 10 seconds and taps "Finish"
Then audio is uploaded and transcribed text appears in text field within 10 seconds

Given transcribed text appears in text field
When user edits the text
Then changes are preserved and user can continue with normal app flow
```

### Error Cases
```
Given user has denied microphone permission
When user taps microphone button
Then permission request dialog appears with clear explanation

Given user starts recording without network connection
When user finishes recording
Then offline transcription processes audio and shows result within 5 seconds

Given network fails during audio upload
When upload fails
Then app automatically switches to offline transcription with user notification

Given server returns transcription error
When error occurs
Then user sees retry option and automatic fallback to offline mode
```

### Edge Cases
```
Given user is recording audio
When app goes to background for 30 seconds
Then recording state is preserved and can be resumed when app returns

Given user records for maximum duration (60 seconds)
When time limit is reached
Then recording auto-stops and transcription begins automatically

Given user taps cancel during recording
When cancellation occurs
Then recording stops, audio is deleted, and user returns to idle state

Given user records only silence/noise
When transcription completes with empty result
Then user sees helpful message and option to try again
```
